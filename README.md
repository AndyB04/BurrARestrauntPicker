restraunt picker - Github

Peer Review: Arely Martinez -- The program did its job of giving me a restraunt name depending on what I entered. There was data validation for that and at the end of the program where it ask the user to play again. There are just some small adjustments I would make like changing the code to where if they enter a variation of the options like 'yes', 'no', 'chinese', 'american' etc, where it would also take those reponses. (That could be done with a ToUpper(); or ToLower(); ). Overall the program did its job.
